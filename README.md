# Beatmap Sharing

A attempt at pulling maps en masse from server (main website or mirror)

Firsty, this was made for windows, have 0 idea if it will work for mac/linux

GUI is online and in current development so ease of use should definitely be going up. 

If you want to take a packaged up beatmap set and download all the maps, then use the downloading script.
