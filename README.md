# Beatmap Sharing

script to pull maps en masse from osu beatmap mirror websites. This is now depreciated.

Firsty, this was made for windows, have 0 idea if it will work for mac/linux

GUI is online and in current development so ease of use should definitely be going up. 

If you want to take a packaged up beatmap set and download all the maps, then use the downloading script.
