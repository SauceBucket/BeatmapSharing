# BeatmapSync
A attempt at pulling maps en masse from osu beatmap mirror websites

Using this script shouldnt be too difficult. If you want to package up your beatmap folder then use the search script.

If you want to take a packaged up beatmap set and download all the maps, then use the donloading script. 

Both scripts have prompts for input with little input checking so dont input something dumb or it no work.

let me know @ saucy#7035 or saucy on osu if you have issues or wanna talk to me about this project.
