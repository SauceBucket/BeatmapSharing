# Beatmap Sharing

A attempt at pulling maps en masse from server (main website or mirror)

Firsty, this was made for windows, have 0 idea if it will work for mac/linux

GUI is online and in current development so ease of use should definitely be going up. 

If you want to take a packaged up beatmap set and download all the maps, then use the downloading script. 

let me know @ saucy#7035 or saucy on osu if you have issues or wanna talk to me about this project. vlazer on Osu! might also be able to help you if I am not available 

TOOL IS CURRENTLY ONLY FUNCTIONAL WITH BLOODCAT
We are resolving a issue with logins on the website so the program retains the login state from your session so its actually allowed to download maps from the main site (ppy.sh)
